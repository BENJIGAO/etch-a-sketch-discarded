# Etch-a-Sketch

Note: This project was reworked with React (check out repo name "etch-a-sketch"). It's now only used for demonstration purposes (showing a live website)

This project is a web-based drawing application that is similar to the toy etch-a-sketch (hence the name). It uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to create the desired size for the grid and event listeners to simulate drawing. It also includes many user-friendly cuztomization features, such as an eraser, different color options (including RGB values), and a sliding bar that allows users to control the size of their grid. I'd love to hear any comments or feedback on the UI or code itself if you have any. Enjoy!
