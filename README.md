This project is a web-based drawing application that is similar to the toy etch-a-sketch (hence the name). It uses javascript DOM manipulation to create the desired grid for drawing and event listeners to allow the user control what they draw. It also (hopefully) will include many user-friendly cuztomization featrues, such allowing users to draw in rainbow/any colour of their choosing (provided it's in the list I provide), and a sliding bar that allows users to control the size of their grid.
